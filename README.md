# Overview


[P4 Runtime](https://p4.org/p4-runtime) provides a flexible mechanism for
configuring the forwarding pipeline on a network switch.

[gNMI](https://github.com/openconfig/reference/tree/master/rpc/gnmi) is a
framework for network device management that uses gRPC as the transport
mechanism.

# Source code

This repository contains source code for a reference implementation of
the P4 Runtime and gNMI services, that serves as the hardware abstraction layer
for a network switch. It has been successfully prototyped at Google, running on
production hardware on a data center network subsytem.
